# fastlane-multiple-app-example
A barebones example of the how I'm trying to use fastlane with multiple applications within a single workspace.

Run ``` build_App1.sh ``` & ``` build_App2.sh ```

Currently, the ENV variables aren't being passed correctly to the ipa() function (is that the correct Ruby term here?)
